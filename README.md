# Fuzzy-Interest-Region
This repository contains all codes and data used for Fuzzy Interest Region for Motion Magnification.

"MyFunction.m" is the main code used in Fuzzy Interest Region. To use this code please download phase based motion magnification code from http://people.csail.mit.edu/nwadhwa/phase-video/ and extract the code. Then replace "reproduceResultsSiggraph13.m" and "setPath.m" which are loacated in "\PhaseBasedRelease_20131023\Release" also "phaseAmplify.m" loacated in "\PhaseBasedRelease_20131023\Release\PhaseBased" with "reproduceResultsSiggraph13.m", "setPath.m" and "phaseAmplify.m" uploaded in this repository. 

The other files including:
1- extractAndSaveORB.m
2- MyFunction.m
3- SelectFile.m
4- myFile*.AVI
....
must be copyed in "\PhaseBasedRelease_20131023\Release\data" . 

In this papre OpenCV is used to ORB feature extraction so it must be installed on your matlab.
